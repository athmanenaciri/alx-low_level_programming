# 0x08. C - Recursion

## Description
This repository contains C programs and functions related to recursion, created as part of the "0x08. C - Recursion" project at ALX School.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- What is recursion
- How to implement recursion
- In what situations you should implement recursion
- In what situations you shouldn't implement recursion

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
- You are allowed to use _putchar
- You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
- Don’t forget to push your header file
- You are not allowed to use any kind of loops
- You are not allowed to use static variables

## Tasks
- [Task 0](./0-puts_recursion.c): Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.
- [Task 1](./1-print_rev_recursion.c): Write a function that prints a string in reverse.
- [Task 2](./2-strlen_recursion.c): Write a function that returns the length of a string.
- [Task 3](./3-factorial.c): Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number.
- [Task 4](./4-pow_recursion.c): Write a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.
- [Task 5](./5-sqrt_recursion.c): Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number.
- [Task 6](./6-is_prime_number.c): Write a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.
