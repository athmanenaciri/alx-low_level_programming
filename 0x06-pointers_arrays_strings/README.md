# 0x06. C - More Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

This directory contains C programs and functions that focus on advanced concepts related to pointers, arrays, and strings. These programs were created as part of the ALX School's low-level programming curriculum.

## List of Tasks

1. **0-strcat.c**: A C program that defines a function to concatenate two strings.

2. **1-strncat.c**: A C program that defines a function to concatenate two strings but with a specified limit on the number of bytes from the source string.

3. **2-strncpy.c**: A C program that defines a function to copy a string with a specified limit on the number of bytes from the source string.

4. **3-strcmp.c**: A C program that defines a function to compare two strings.

5. **4-rev_array.c**: A C program that defines a function to reverse the content of an array of integers.

6. **5-string_toupper.c**: A C program that defines a function to change all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.

7. **6-cap_string.c**: A C program that defines a function to capitalize all words of a string, based on specific word separators.

8. **7-leet.c**: A C program that defines a function to encode a string into "leet" or "1337" speak.

## Usage

To compile these programs, you can use the following commands:

```shell
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 main.c <file-name>.c -o <output-file>
