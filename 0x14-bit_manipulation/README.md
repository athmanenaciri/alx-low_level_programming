# 0x14. C - Bit Manipulation

## Description
This repository contains C programs and functions that demonstrate bit manipulation techniques. The project includes various functions for converting, setting, clearing, and flipping bits in binary numbers.

## Learning Objectives
- Learn to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators.
- Search for the right source of information with minimal assistance.

## Mandatory Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All code files should be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with the following flags: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
- All code files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory.
- Code should follow the Betty style.
- Usage of global variables is not allowed.
- Each code file should contain no more than 5 functions.
- Only standard library functions `malloc`, `free`, and `exit` are allowed. Functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc`, etc., are forbidden.
- The `_putchar` function is allowed but should not be pushed. The repository maintainers will use their own `_putchar` function during compilation.
- Prototypes of all functions and the `_putchar` function should be included in a header file named `main.h`. Don't forget to push your header file.
- All header files should be include guarded.

## Project Structure
- `0-binary_to_uint.c`: Function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
- `1-print_binary.c`: Function that prints the binary representation of a number without using arrays or dynamic memory.
- `2-get_bit.c`: Function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
- `3-set_bit.c`: Function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
- `4-clear_bit.c`: Function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
- `5-flip_bits.c`: Function that returns the number of bits needed to flip to get from one number to another.
