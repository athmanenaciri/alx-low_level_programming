0x04 - C More Functions, More Nested Loops

Welcome to the 0x04 C More Functions, More Nested Loops project by ALX. In this project, you will continue your journey in the C programming language by diving deeper into functions, nested loops, and more.

Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without the help of Google:

General

    What are nested loops and how to use them
    What is a function and how to use functions
    The difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
    What is a prototype
    Scope of variables
    The purpose of the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89
    Header files and how to use them with #include

Tasks
Task 0: isupper

Write a function that checks for an uppercase character.

    Prototype: int _isupper(int c);
    Returns 1 if c is uppercase, 0 otherwise
    The standard library provides a similar function: isupper. Run man isupper to learn more.

Task 1: isdigit

Write a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).

    Prototype: int _isdigit(int c);
    Returns 1 if c is a digit, 0 otherwise
    The standard library provides a similar function: isdigit. Run man isdigit to learn more.

Task 2: Collaboration is Multiplication

Write a function that multiplies two integers.

    Prototype: int mul(int a, int b);

Task 3: The Numbers Speak for Themselves

Write a function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

    Prototype: void print_numbers(void);
    You can only use _putchar twice in your code.

Task 4: I Believe in Numbers and Signs

Write a function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

    Prototype: void print_most_numbers(void);
    Do not print 2 and 4
    You can only use _putchar twice in your code.

Task 5: Numbers Constitute the Only Universal Language

Write a function that prints 10 times the numbers from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.

    Prototype: void more_numbers(void);
    You can only use _putchar three times in your code.

Task 6: The Shortest Distance Between Two Points is a Straight Line

Write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.

    Prototype: void print_line(int n);
    You can only use _putchar function to print
    Where n is the number of times the character _ should be printed
    The line should end with a \n
    If n is 0 or less, the function should only print \n

Task 7: I Feel Like I am Diagonally Parked in a Parallel Universe

Write a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.

    Prototype: void print_diagonal(int n);
    You can only use _putchar function to print
    Where n is the number of times the character \ should be printed
    The diagonal should end with a \n
    If n is 0 or less, the function should only print a \n

Task 8: You Are So Much Sunshine in Every Square Inch

Write a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.

    Prototype: void print_square(int size);
    You can only use _putchar function to print
    Where size is the size of the square
    If size is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line
    Use the character # to print the square

Task 9: Fizz-Buzz

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print FizzBuzz.

    Each number or word should be separated by a space
    You are allowed to use the standard library

Task 10: Triangles

Write a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.

    Prototype: void print_triangle(int size);
    You can only use _putchar function to print
    Where size is the size of the triangle
    If size is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line
    Use the character # to print the triangle
